## Prompt

Create or update the feature specification from a natural language feature description.

## Response snapshot

I have created a comprehensive feature specification for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. The specification includes:

- User scenarios with prioritized user stories covering ROS 2 fundamentals, Gazebo simulation, NVIDIA Isaac platform, conversational robotics, and the capstone project
- Functional requirements for the educational modules and assessment tools
- Key entities such as students, course modules, simulation environments, and hardware platforms
- Measurable success criteria with specific percentages and timeframes

The specification has been validated against quality criteria and is ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete spec for physical AI robotics course
- 🧪 Tests: 
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all required components of the physical AI course
